We all love attention.  Hell, I only post messages in GroupMe with the hopes of
getting likes.  That is why I created the LikeBot.

LikeBot is very simple to run and works for all GroupMe groups.

First, you need to get a token to access the groupme api.

Next, create a bot at https://dev.groupme.com/bots

After creating your bot, specify which group you want it to be a part of

Using your token, group_id and bot_id, fill in the respective paramaters in
the actual Python script

This is a very primitive implementation.  Code is commented out which saves 
the state of the user_dictionary so that the bot does not need to read all the
messages in the chat, it will start at the last time it was called.  It will
be saved in a text file, because it is easy to work with

FUTURE PLANS:
Deploy code on web-service
Allow members of group to @ the bot and get the amount of likes they
have in the chat
